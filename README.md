# Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) vs Google Maps API

A simple WordPress plugin that allows users to enter their Google Maps Javascript API key, to fix the "Development only" message on ACF, and the Front End.

Please note: This plugin enqueues the Google Maps JS library on the front end, to disable this, comment out line 132. Although, that would be silly because you need the API Key. You should ensure your theme isn't including the Javascript API instead, or you may create a JS conflict.

Disclaimer: I take ZERO responsibility for this plugin, and give no guarantee that it works - at all. Use it at your own risk. See points 14 and 15 of the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE for more info.
